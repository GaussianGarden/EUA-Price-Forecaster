I would expect the latin alphabet to be most prevalent, common text symbols (such as commas, question marks and so on) to be moderately common and emojis to be even less common. Our goal here is to find out which symbols to look for when working with the text. An initial hypothesis might be that a chart symbol depicting a downward trend is an important indicator of a potentially import economic event."

An easy approach to include such meaning in the tweet text is to replace the visual representation with a textual representation, e.g. to replace \"😱\" with the word \"shocked\". I already prepared such a function for this purpose which will come in handy when the data is prepared."
